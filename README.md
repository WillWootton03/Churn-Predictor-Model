# Project Description
As I come to terms with the brutal reality of the current state of the hell that is the CS internship market I figure I should spend more time pursuing and learning what I have always been interested in. I will continue to work on my web-apps like my health app and I hope to introduce multiple ML models and perhaps an AI chatbot in the end to that app, however I will be shifting my focus to more ML project for the coming months.
I have always been interested in AI and I think my acceptance of the low-probability of a potential internship allows me to focus more on diving into technical books on AI and ML instead of grinding project to put on my portfolio.

This is a very simple predictor model that simply predicts if a user will leave or stay, 1 would be true they leave, while 0 would be false they stay. Found off of a 5 year old youtube video, so I had to do quite a bit of digging and research to find out what to actually put. Will continue to make a few predictor models in the future and maybe some more on this data set as well in order to practice and get the hang of using tensorflow. Most important for me though is actually understanding the math behind these models so I might not make any commits for the coming days while I study up on that.
